# TAN

`TAN` is a trigonometric function (tangent).

## Description

`TAN` takes 1 argument (the angle) and calculates `tan(angle)`.

The angle is in degrees and should be between 0 and 360.

`TAN` is undefined for angles whose cosine is 0 (90 and 270).
Passing these angles to `TAN` will cause your script to crash.

## Usage

`TAN <angle>;`

## Examples

`TAN 45;` - Evaluates `tan(45)` and stores the result in the result register.
