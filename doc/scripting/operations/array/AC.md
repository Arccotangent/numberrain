# AC

`AC` is a special operation.

## Description

`AC` takes any amount of arguments and constructs an array from them. The resulting array is stored in the result
register.

Passing an array to `AC` will cause your script to crash.

Passing no arguments to `AC` will create an empty array.

Data types can be mixed (eg. reals and vectors can be stored in the same array).

## Usage

`AC [element 1] [element 2] ... [element n];`
