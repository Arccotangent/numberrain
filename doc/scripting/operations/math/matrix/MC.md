# MC

`MC` is a special operation.

## Description

`MC` takes any amount of array arguments and constructs a matrix from them.

Arrays passed to `MC` must contain only real numbers and integers. Passing arrays containing vectors, matrices, or other
data types will cause your script to crash.

Passing no arguments to `MC` will result in an empty matrix.

## Usage

`MC [array 1] [array 2] ... [array n];`
